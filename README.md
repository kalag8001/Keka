2. Open the Project:
   - Launch Android Studio and open the existing project by selecting "Open an existing Android Studio project" from the welcome screen.

3. Verify Project Structure:
   - Confirm that the project structure includes necessary files such as activity.xml, task.kt, taskada.ky, and mainactivity.kt.

4. Configure Emulator or Connect a Device:
   - Set up an Android Virtual Device (AVD) in Android Studio or connect a physical Android device to your computer for testing.

5. Check Dependencies:
   - If the project relies on external dependencies or libraries, ensure they are correctly configured in the project's build.gradle files.

6. Build and Run:
   - Click on the "Run" button in the toolbar or go to "Run" > "Run 'app'" from the menu. This will build the project and launch the application on the emulator or connected device.

7. Monitor Logs for Debugging:
   - Keep an eye on the Logcat tab in Android Studio to view logs and debug information. This is crucial for troubleshooting any issues that may arise.

8. Test Features:
   - Interact with the application on the emulator or device to thoroughly test features like due dates, priority levels, categories, and task status.

9. Debugging Tools:
   - Use the debugging tools provided by Android Studio to identify and address any issues during testing.

10. Distribution (if applicable):
    - If you are satisfied with the application, you can distribute it by generating an APK file or consider publishing it on the Google Play Store.
